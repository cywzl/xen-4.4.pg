The technical debt has accrued so much that there are now binary
incompatibilites with Xen-4.2, which lead to triple faults in windows
guests running older PV drivers.

The "legacy" drivers make the HVMOP_set_driver_version hypercall which
has been included for donkey's years as a NOOP.  Finally now we need to
use it to enable legacy quirks mode.

The "newstyle" Tampa drivers for Vista and newer do not make this
hypercall, but also do not use the old hacks we have in place and use
the correct upstream ABI.
