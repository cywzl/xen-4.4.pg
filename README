This is the repository of XenServer-specific patches to Xen.

To contribute bug fixes, email them to the XenServer development mailing
list (xs-devel@lists.xenserver.org).

For any new features, please work with the upstream Xen project and
request backports by emailing the XenServer development mailing list
(xs-devel@lists.xenserver.org).

Refer to http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Submitting_Xen_Patches for
information on contributing to the Xen project.

Note: Some of the patches in this series introduce hypercall ABI
changes that are incompatible with upstream Xen.
